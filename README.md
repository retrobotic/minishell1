#### **/!\ Warning /!\**
This is a first year Epitech project, it is therefore subjected to the "C Norm" wich is a programming style convention created by the school.
Some restriction of this norm are for example "max 25 lines per function and 5 functions per file", "only one instruction per line", "no global variables"
"no system function (recode them to use them)", etc...
The full epitech norm : https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/_persistent/norme-en.pdf?file=74-190945&v=0&c=true
So if some part of the code seems weird in their syntax, it's probably due to this norm.

The goal of this project was to program a UNIX command interpreter. The executables are those that we can find in the path indicated in PATH variable, if an executable
cannot be found, an error message must be diplayed. A series of builtins must be implemented (cd, setenv, unsetenv, env, exit). The reference shell
is tcsh.

Allowed functions :

* opendir
* readdir
* closedir
* getcwd
* malloc
* free
* exit
* chdir
* fork
* stat
* lstat
* fstat
* open
* close
* read
* write
* execve
* access
* wait
* waitpid
* wait3
* wait4
* signal
